This script is a collection of tiny scripts because I did not know there was a script limit in SA-MP. It is ongoing, so there are bugs everywhere and parts can be easily condensed into each other (see freeze).

There are plans to condense some functions and fix known bugs, and I am always adding commands.

This SA-MP script is licensed under the WTFPL version 2. I personally ask that you leave the comments at the top alone. Some are there to make the code easy to look through. I understand that the code is ugly, please do not comment about it. I am very aware of it.
